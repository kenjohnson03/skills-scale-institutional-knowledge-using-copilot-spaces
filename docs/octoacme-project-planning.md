# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. **UX Designer**: Identify features requiring design work and create design timeline
4. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
5. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
6. Identify dependencies and integration points
7. Create release plan and milestone map with **Release Manager**
8. **Customer Support Liaison**: Review backlog for customer-impacting items and support readiness needs
