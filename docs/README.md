OctoAcme's project management approach is structured around a clear lifecycle (Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close/Retrospective) and a small set of core artifacts that keep work aligned and discoverable. New efforts begin with a lightweight Project One-pager to capture the problem, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and an initial timeline. Planning converts approved initiatives into a prioritized, estimated backlog with acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done; teams record dependencies and risks in a Risk Register and map releases and milestones in a release plan. Execution is managed on a project board with columns like Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done to visualize flow and handoffs.

Workflows emphasize incremental delivery and disciplined change control. Pull requests are expected to be small (ideally ≤ 400 lines), include issue links and acceptance criteria, run CI (tests, linting, security scans) before review, and require at least one approval. Sprint/iteration planning pulls only items that meet the DoD and capacity constraints. Release and deployment follow a checklist-driven process (staging smoke tests, automated pipelines where possible, release notes, rollback/mitigation plans) and distinguish patch, minor, and major release types. Post-deploy verifications and an incident playbook (notify on-call, triage, rollback if needed) close the loop on operational risk.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit so ownership is clear across the lifecycle. Product Managers define the problem, outcomes, and success metrics; Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Developers implement features, tests, and reviews; UX Designers ensure intuitive, accessible user experiences; Release Managers coordinate deployment activities and release schedules; Customer Support Liaisons bridge the gap between users and development teams; QA/testing owns validation and acceptance; stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. The Personas document is used to frame scenarios and ensure consistent expectations for collaboration, estimation, and reviews. Dedicated handoff and coordination processes (UX Design Handoff, Release Coordination, and Support Readiness) provide actionable checklists and templates for cross-functional collaboration.

Communication and quality assurance are baked into cadence and artifacts. Team rhythm includes daily standups for progress and blockers, a weekly delivery sync (and a weekly PM–PdM alignment), scheduled demos at sprint/milestone end, and monthly stakeholder updates. Reporting uses dashboards for velocity, burndown, errors, and usage signals; status and incident templates standardize updates. QA practices require unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, CI-based security scanning, and manual QA or acceptance testing where needed—combined with branching/PR conventions, checklisted releases, and tracked retrospective action items to continuously improve.
