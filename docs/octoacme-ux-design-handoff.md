# OctoAcme — UX Design Handoff Process

## Purpose
Ensure smooth collaboration between UX Designers and Developers, with clear design specifications and acceptance criteria for user-facing features.

## When to Use
- Any feature with new or significantly changed user interface elements
- User workflows that require usability consideration
- Updates to existing UI that affect user experience

## UX Design Workflow

### 1. Discovery & Research
- Collaborate with Product Manager on user needs and requirements
- Conduct user research if needed (interviews, surveys, analytics review)
- Review Customer Support Liaison feedback on user pain points
- Document design goals and success criteria

### 2. Design & Iteration
- Create wireframes for early feedback
- Develop high-fidelity mockups and prototypes
- Conduct design reviews with stakeholders
- Iterate based on feedback from Product Manager and team

### 3. Design Handoff
- Prepare design specifications and assets
- Document interaction patterns and edge cases
- Share design files in accessible location (e.g., Figma, Sketch)
- Schedule handoff meeting with developers

### 4. Development Support
- Attend sprint planning to clarify design requirements
- Review PRs for design fidelity
- Answer questions during implementation
- Validate design in staging environment

### 5. Validation & Refinement
- Conduct usability testing on staging or beta releases
- Gather feedback from Customer Support Liaison
- Document design decisions and learnings
- Iterate on design improvements for future releases
